# Metro
Metro/Subway Fast Travel System

### About
This resource was my first project on Fivem. I'm excited to release it and improve it in the future.

### How the resource works
- Allows players to fast travel between the various stations in Los Santos
- The fast travel is only available at every multiple of 5 minutes past the hour (e.g. 12:00, 12:05, 12:10, 12:15...)
- This means players who use the system to escape someone need to time their arrival at the station correctly
- and pursuers have complete information on when the fast travel system is active
- Teleporter to enable players to use the 'unfinished' Pillbox North Station

### Installation
1) Download the latest version in the "code" tab on GitHub.
2) Drag & drop the folder into your `resources` server folder.
3) Configure the config file to your liking.
4) Add `start metro` to your server config.
